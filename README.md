# AI-searching-GeneticAlgorithm
Genetic Algorithm Python implementation based on Russell &amp; Norvig


## Example

Given the equation

f(x1, x2, ..., xn) = w1·x1 + w2·x2 + ... wn·xn

Search for a set of independent variables, X

```{python}
X = {x1, x2, ..., xn}
```

which maximize f(x1, x2, ... xn)


## Solution

Having for example ```W``` defined as:

```{python}
W = [2.5, 3.4, -1.9, 4.9, 0, -8, 1]
```

run

```{bash}
python3 GeneticAlgorithm_Example.py
```
